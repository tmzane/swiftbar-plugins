# SwiftBar plugins

[![ci](https://github.com/tmzane/swiftbar-plugins/actions/workflows/python.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tmzane/swiftbar-plugins/actions/workflows/python.yml)

A collection of my plugins for [SwiftBar][1] (also compatible with [xbar][2]).

## ðŸ“¦ Install

> Python 3.11+ is required

1. [Install SwiftBar][3] (if not already)

2. Clone this repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tmzane/swiftbar-plugins
```

3. Create a symlink to the selected plugin in your [Plugin Folder][4]

```shell
ln -s /path/to/repo/plugin_name.py $SWIFTBAR_PLUGINS_PATH/plugin_name.py
```

## ðŸ”Œ Plugins

* [Docker containers](#docker-containers)
* [Homebrew upgrades](#homebrew-upgrades)
* [Pomodoro timer](#pomodoro-timer)

Most plugins support configuration via top-level constants, such as `PLUGIN_ICON`.
Feel free to modify them for your needs.

### Docker containers

### Homebrew upgrades

List and upgrade outdated Homebrew packages.
